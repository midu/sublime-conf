## My Custom Sublime conf

This is my very personal conf. I'm still building this so there's a lot missing.

I'll add the bundles/packages when I have time.

### Install

I put the stuff in the User folder in the Packages folder of Sublime so there's 0 risk of losing my conf when I upgrade Sublime

```bash
mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User.backup
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
git clone git@github.com:midu/sublime-conf.git User
```

Or something like that.

### What does it do

#### Theme

Uses the [Railscasts theme](http://railscasts.com/about), wich means you'll need the [Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/) font installed on your system.

I also set a big ass `23 points` font size because I have a big screen and I like to see my text.
